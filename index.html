								<span class="image main"><img src="images/portfolio2.jpg" alt=""  /></span>
								<h5>A little info about me..</h5>
								<p>I was born and raised on the southwest coast of Norway, where i lived for the vast majority of my life before i started univeristy to pursue my interest in IT in 2017. During my time at univeristy i had the chance to work with several differnet coding languages, along with some of the different tools and softwares that one might use working with them. </p>
								<p>After i finished university in June 2020 i relocated to Northern Ireland, and have been living here ever since. I am currently located in Co.Antrim and living here with my new family.
								<p>Until now i have been working as a technical support specialist, while working on some <a href="#projects"><b>projects</b></a> for my employer on the side, but also some personal ones at home to build upon on my skills & knowledge. I am at a point now where i really want to try to get a job within the development business, be that Software, Web or even Game developement. 
								<p>I hope that this portfolio will give you an idea of what i can do, and that i can be the right man for the job!</p>

								<h3>2D Platforming Game (C#)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2dgame.png" alt=""  /></span>
								<p>I got inspired to try out game development after the release of Unreal Engine 5. After downloading it and realising that my laptop was not near good enough to utilize the engine i decided to try something less demanding and after doing some research ended up trying my hand at Unity.</p> 
								<p>Never having coded in C# before i had to start from scratch and do my research to get going and a lot of time went into getting the basics of the game going rather then jumping right into the fun part of making it look great. I have yet to finish the game, but it remains a personal side project that i can pull out and work on from time to time. </p>
								<h3>Web developement (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP)</h3>
								<h5><u>Shopify & WordPress</u></h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aestelecom.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the start of 2022 i was given to opportunity to start working on website related tasks, which is outside my job title. But i jumped on this chance to learn and grow my skills as i knew that any experience would be great for me.</p>
								<p>Initially the tasks were simple HTML & CSS work, creating information pages. But it then moved into maintaining one of my employers <a href="https://aesglobalparts.com/"><b>shopify stores </b> </a>. Since then i have taken over one my employers websites hosted on WordPress where i had to re-design the <a href="https://aesglobaltelecom.com/"><b>website</b></a> and maintain it.</p>
								<p>I had no experience with either Shopify or WordPress and had to teach myself how to utilize these platforms through research. I very much enjoy the challenge of having to learn something new and the sense off acomplishment when you see things come together. So should any future employer require a certain skillset that i may not already have i would be more than happy, given the chance to learn and prove my potential.</p>
								<h5><u>Form Building</u></h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/warrantypopup.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>One of my most recent projects have been creating a multi-page form that sends both an email with the form data to a set address, and also fills this same data into a google sheet so it can easily be maintained. </p>
								<p>I have utilized a couple of tools for this, one being "Parserr" to get the data automatically filled into the google sheet.</p>
								<h3>Android Application (JAVA)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/iheatapp.png" alt="" height="" /></span>
								<p>The iHeat app is one of many applications my employer has, and i was recently given the opportunity to work on this to finish and maintain. </p>
								<p>The app itself is designed to operate central heating systems via SMS messages. The way it works is that the app auto-generates the different messages and will prompt you to send these messages to the system using a number you store. It was made using AndroidStudio and Java. </p>
